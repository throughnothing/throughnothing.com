%(fl)W% e love travelling.  Luckily, the Thanksgiving holiday gives us some free time to travel some place close (and usually/hopefuly cheap) without having to take many days off from work.  Angelle has been itching to go to Boston lately as she has never been before, and I'm always willing to go just about anywhere (plus it's been a while since I've been to Boston, so I could use a refresher).  Once Angelle found super cheap flights and a great deal on a hotel, it was a done deal: Boston, here we come!

In order to save money (and bypass large crowds at the airport) we departed on Thanksgiving day.  I'm not sure if either of us have travelled on Thanksgiving day before, but its nice to have short lines and an airport mostly to ourselves.  Another plus is that we had the whole row to ourselves on the flight.

Everyhting was on time, and upon arriving in Boston, we caught the bus to the Blue Line, changed over to the Green Line, and checked into the hotel.  After a brief respite, we were off to the "Freedom Trail":http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/.

The Freedom Trail is full of history around every turn.  In no time we had seen the Boston Commons, the Massachussetts State House, the Park Street Church, the Granary Graveyard, the King's Chape Burial Ground, Old City Hall, the Old State House, and the Boston Massacre Site.

As the night rolled in (along with the cold!) we knew we wouldn't finish the entire Freedom Trail today.  Before we could wonder what to do next, we arrived at Quincy Market.  Perfect Timing.  Quincy Market had wonderful holiday lighting, and a few restaurants where we could grab a snack to hold us over until our Thanksgiving Dinner at "The Fireplace":http://www.fireplacerest.com/home/.  We settled on "Cheers":http://www.cheersboston.com/pub/ (not the original) to grab some drinks and some fries.  The timing was more perfect than we originally thought: the Saints game was just starting!  Relaxing over some drinks and cheese fries while watching the Saints game in the warm interior of Cheers was just what we needed for our cold first night in Boston.

After our drinks and delicious cheese fries, we had a little time to walk around before our reservation at The Fireplace for dinner, so we wandered around Boston aimlessly for a bit.  We stumbled upon Paul Revere's house, as well as some statues and parks, before finally hopping on the metro towards Brookline for dinner.  By this point, we were pretty exhausted and could easily have just gone to sleep right on the metro, but we knew dinner at the Fireplace would be worth it.

Finally, we arrive at The Fireplace.  Once inside, we find that the quaint little restaurant on the corner is packed and bustling on the inside.  Several parties are waiting by the door to be seated.  We push our way through to ask about our reservation and are reassured that we should be seated on time.  They seemed incredibly busy, so we were happy to be seated just a few minutes late.

The food came out very promptly, and everything was delicious.  We had some Red Diamond Merlot from Washington, and a very tasty Cheese Platter to start off.  Angelle got a caeser salad and a side of honey-soaked carrots, while I opted for the salmon with a side of brussels sprouts, bacon, and apples.  Everything was delicious, and by the time we were done, we were both ready to pass out.  Fighting the cold, we hurry to the metro and head to the hotel to pass out.  We hope to get to an early start tomorrow.
