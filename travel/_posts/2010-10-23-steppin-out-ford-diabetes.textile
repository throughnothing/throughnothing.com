Today my company, "Siteworx":http://www.siteworx.com, was one of the sponsors of the "Steppin' Out for Diabetes":http://main.diabetes.org/site/TR/StepOut/DistrictofColumbiaMetroArea?pg=entry&fr_id=7239 walk/run in Washington D.C.  The course starts and ends by the Nationals stadium in southern D.C.

We got there pretty early, before many other people were there.  At least parking was easy!  Plus we had to support our Siteworx crew that was out there even earlier than us setting up the nice booth :)

It was a pretty chilly morning, we all wore vibrams to the event to keep our feet warm, but Andy and I were planning on shedding the vibrams for the run.

After walking around for a bit and checking out all that there was to see (not much, except for a pretty good dance group doing some cool stuff), it was time to shed the shoes!

After some waiting around, the "race" was off to a....slow start.  We initially had to weave through the hundreds of walkers until we got out of the stadium and into the streets where there was more room to get out in front of all the walkers.  Once we got to that point it was smooth sailing....almost.

The main complaint I have is that the course was very poorly marked in many locations, and it seemed other runners and walkers were having difficulty following and seeing the signs as well.  I'm still not sure if we did the entire course correctly (we definitely made a few wrong turns and had to loop back), but according to my iPhone we only ended up running 4 miles, not the complete 5. But at least we made it to the finish, and we were feeling great.
