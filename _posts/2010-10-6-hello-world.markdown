Already wearing on us that we can't get anything accomplished with our writing. This doesn't bode well; we've only been in Mongolia for three days. Even though we've decided to throw ourselves into this new adventure without writing about it immediately (the dynamic of traveling with a group of people is not conducive to how we work), it is proving difficult to break this cathartic and rewarding daily habit.  

In addition to our now neglected daily journals, there is one more project weighing on our minds. A few days before we met the Mongol Ralliers, we were commissioned by Rough Guides to write a few travel pieces. They, unlike our entries, cannot be postponed indefinitely. The due date is rapidly approaching, and we've yet to make the time to work on them.  

It would be foolish to pass on this opportunity, but the decisions required of us not to are a hard pill to swallow. We need to be away from people and distractions. All we want is to be a part of this team, but right now, we need solitude and time. So, as the group prepares to leave around 2PM, we reluctantly choose responsibility over fun, and say farewell.  

Once we've collected the things of ours which have strayed into communal ownership (potato peeler, pots and pans etc), we head to the nearest restaurant to work. It takes four solid hours of writing, a pair of beers, and a few mutton dumplings before our respective editorials are complete. We're both elated, feeling as though a heavy weight has been lifted from our shoulders.  

In the midst of our enthusiasm, we decide not to spend the night in ﾃ僕gii. Throwing caution and better judgement to the wind, we set off, inadvisedly choosing to chase after our friends. It is 7PM by the time we hit the rocky roads of Mongolia. Night is fast approaching.
