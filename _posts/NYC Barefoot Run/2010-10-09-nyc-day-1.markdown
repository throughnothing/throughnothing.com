Today got off to an early 5:15am start.  The plan was to leave around 6am, but after some last minute changes to the group, we ended up heading out close to 7am, which is still not too terrible.

Once on the road, the first stop was Dunkin' Donuts to please the hungry.

After fueling up, we were set for the trek to New York City.

We finally arrived at our hotel (in southern NY, around the Financial District) just before noon, but of course, could not check-in until 3pm.  Since we wanted to make it to the running clinics in central park before the last clinic at 3pm, we decided to just leave our luggage with the hotel and hit the metro....after grabbing some much-needed lunch.

Walking from the hotel, we quickly found Fulton St. with a bunch of shops and restaurants, and grabbed a quick bite  at [JP Mustard's] before heading to the metro for central park.

Tip Top Shoes ended up being on the way from the metro to central park, so we stopped there to pick up our race packets before heading to the clinics.  Tip Top Shoes was pretty crowded, and this was our first taste of how awesome this event was going to be: lots of people in vibrams, lots of people buying injinji socks and picking up their packets.

Arriving in Central Park after packet pickup, I was amazed at how _crowded_ the park was.  I never thought we'd find the barefoot running group, even as obvious as you would think it would be to spot such a group.  Luckily, we managed to somehow stumble upon the group by spotting [Barefoot Ted] (BFT).

We just made it for the 3PM clinic, and were divided up into groups.  Barefoot Ted took our group, and we set about trotting lightly through central park, receiving insight, tips, and wisdom from BFT all along the way.

BFT is definitely an interesting and talkative character, but he comes across as very sincere in what he says, and is always as nice as can be.  Thanks for the great clinic BFT!


The clinic went by pretty quick, and then we pretty much had the rest of the day to sightsee and enjoy the city.  Walking the streets just south of Central Park, we came across a street festival with lots of great smelling food, and loads of people crowding the blocked-off street.

After some delicious Souvlaki, we worked our way through the streets and down to Rockefeller Center to sit for a bit and enjoy the Ice Skaters and wonderful weather.  We also decided to check out a nearby Church (St. Patrick's Cathedral) that is having a Saturday Service.

As this would be our only night in NYC, we decided to make our way down to Times Square before getting dinner and calling it a night.  Angelle really wanted to find the M&M store, so after navigating our way through herds of kids in Toys "R" Us to ask a worker where the M&M store was, we quickly retreaded from the chaotic super-toy-store as fast as possible.

[![M&M Store Mugs](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5070717262_5a2c5dae03.jpg)](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5070717262_5a2c5dae03_z.jpg)

I guess as is to be expected, the check-out lines in the M&M store were _long_ and we decided it was probably not worth a 1 hour wait in line to taste some exotic M&M flavors that we'd never tried before, so we looked around, checked out what they had, and promptly scurried out.

Times Square was so crowded that we couldn't handle it for long, it must've taken 15 minutes just to walk one block as you flow with the herd at whatever pace it decides to move at.  Since we needed to wake up early (5am again!? :() for the race the next day, we decide to get outta Times Square, grab some dinner, and head for the hotel to pass out.

After a few attempts at a Thai Tappas Restaurant and a Pizzeria that both had a wait for a table, we settled in on [Jack Bistro Bar] in Greenwich Village, and we certainly did not regret it.  Everything was delicious, and nobody had problems cleaning their plate.

Stuffed and tired, we headed back to the hotel on the metro.  When we got to our exit stop, we thought we were locked in, as several of the exit gates were locked, but further on down we managed to get out and make our way home.
