So there is the first group of NYC Barefoot Runners.  Of course, the day started off pretty early, with another 5am wakeup, a quick breakfast of some pork sausages (maybe?), an apple, and an orange, courtesy of the Hampton Inn. Then it was off to the metro.

We saw a few runners at the metro, but they were heading to the Staten Island Half Marathon, which was apparently that day as well. I did notice that New York is nice and peaceful in the morning; a welcome change from the rowdiness and noises of the day.

We made it to the ferry station in time to make the first ferry boat.  There were lots of people wearing vibrams, huaraches, and even completely barefoot.  For once, normal shoes were the minority!

Since we made it on the first boat, we were pretty early to the island, and had lots of time to walk around, warm up a little bit, and take advantage of the Paleo snacks of bananas, avacados, walnuts, almonds, apples, and even coconut water. It was pretty chilly, probably in the 40's, and I was worried about how cold my feet were.  I put on my injinji socks for a little bit before the race to try and help warm my toes up.  This would probably be the coldest I've run in barefoot so far, so I wasn't sure how my feet would handle it, but luckily they handled it just fine.

And look at all the beautiful bare feet at the starting line :)

John Durant and Barefoot Ted helped get the race started, and before we knew it, everyone was running at their own pace around the island.  Andy and I did 1 lap normally to get warmed up, and then ran into Barefoot Ted and his group running the "wrong" way on the track and decided to follow along.  BFT led us through the center of the island over grassy patches, through a moat, under a bridge, and even attempted to climb a statue.  We also stopped and ate some unknown fruit from a tree on the island that we later suspected to be crab apples (but who knows!?).

After running/playing/jumping around the island for a little bit, we decided it was time we "finish" the race.

We hung out for a little bit "after" (others were still running) the race, and I even won a T-Shirt (albeit an XL) from the vibram booth. Ready to head back, we hopped the ferry back to the mainland, and hit the metro to the hotel to try and meet up with the rest of our group.

After relaxing and recharging for an hour at the hotel, we decided to go see ground zero (even though we found out there is still literally _nothing_ to see) and then grab a bite to eat.  There was not time to do much before we would need to start heading back home, so we mostly walked around the area near our hotel and by the water, just enjoying the beautiful day.  I'll leave off with a nice photo of me sporting my NYC Barefoot Run T-shirt.
