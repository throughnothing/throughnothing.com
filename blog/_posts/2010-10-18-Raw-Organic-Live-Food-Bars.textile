%(fl)T% oday, while checking out at Whole Foods with Angelle, I decided to take a look at some of the energy/power bars overflowing the checkout aisle.  I usually never bother to look because they are almost always loaded with junk that I don't want. 

This time, however, a "Raw Organic Live Food Bar":http://www.rawindulgence.com/ caught my eye and got me to investigate.

I jumped to the ingredients first, as I usually do, and was quite surprised.  The ingredients ist for each of their bars was 5-7 ingredients, with no chemical names, or anything that grandma' wouldn't recognize (as food).  It seems like these things are made out of _food_!

I picked up a Cashew & Agave Nectar bar to give it a try, and it turned out to taste pretty tasty, too.  I could tell that they had a decent amount of sugar though -- probably from the dates and agave nectar. According to the packaging these things pack in 30 grams of carbs, which is definitely a little bit high for me.  The bar also contains 19 grams of sugars, and 7g of protein.

As a general rule I try to avoid "power bars" and "health bars" and things of that nature -- regardless of their ingredients -- just because they are so processed and generaly don't resemble anything that actually looks like food.  Today I decided to give these a try, and probably won't buy one again for a looong time, but maybe if I'm on the go and in a bind and can find these somewhere, it would be better than the alternatives.  I'm also thinking maybe airplane/travel meals?  I've been thinking about things I'll be able to bring with me to eat at the airport and on the plain for my upcoming trip to Greece.  My hope is that i'll be able to find a Chipotle in the airport, but I'm guessing that probably won't happen in Europe :P
